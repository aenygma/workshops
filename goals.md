The larger goal here is simple, but hard to achieve: **_Actually learn and_ in-corp-orate _things_**

I'll need help, so if this seems like something you'd be interested in, drop a line.

1) Personally, I'm sick of talking to people in this industry who don't know how things work fundamentally and what the impacts are. I'm no Oracle and I also include myself in this group.

2) There is a staggering lack of imagination in this industry. What Heidegger would say "meditative thinking" or bringing these concepts closer to one's thinking and understanding them natively.  
{
  * All these concepts are is an instantiated form of a general idea. 
  * Traditional Computer Science concepts are not here to reveal some great secret of computing.   
  * In fact, they are to be read as an apology, of giving a compromised form to something far more interesting, elegant and beautiful.  
    i.e. They are pointing to something far, far more interesting.  
}  

3) To drive at the deeper idea, that explicates all others.


This is a fairly lofty goal, and likely a stupid one. But its the only way I've found this field exciting.  
Not the gadgetry, not the glint and a-la-mode fashions, but the deeper understanding that can be employed by your creativity.
