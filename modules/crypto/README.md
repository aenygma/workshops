I wanted to get an autograph by one of my childhood heroes, and so I wrote to
the listed agency, along with the letter was something to autograph and then
an envelope with postage and return address.

This made me think.

They specifically requested a SASE,
Self-Addressed stamped envelope), which is just an envelope with my own name and
address, along with a stamp for shipping back to me.

This is quite a neat idea. and it must be appreciated fully.

This simple move, makes the service on the receiving end, much more automated.
All they have to do is perform whatever request you mailed the letter for, and
return some response in the SASE.

I have also used this for applications to just acknowledge the reciept of
package.

The SASE here serves multiple purpose, 1) a way of making it easy for the
recipient to respond, and then 2) acknowledgment of receipt.

In the abstract, a SASE is a pointer back to the original sender. Not unlike a
boomerang, in some sense. There is a going forward, but with the memory of where
it came from, in case it should return.

It could be used for other purposes too.

For example, if the envelope was notarized, then it would serve as a
proof-of-residency and even authentication that you (the sender) are who you state
you are.
This is assuming that you trust the notary system. Let's say we do, and without
a doubt.


The envelope could be sealed in a tamper-evident tape, say like the ones
where if you peel it, only some comes off. Thereby showing that someone else
tried to open it.
This is very much like how they used Mica stamps in the past. They'd stamp a
folded message with a mica seal (especially a intricate designed or some
identifying emblem), so that if someone opened it would be obvious, since
cracked open.
